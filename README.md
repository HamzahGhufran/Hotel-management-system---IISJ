The first project i developed in my High School , 
written in the outdated syntax of C++ , this project allows us to create a customer database , review it , alter customer details 
as well as delete them , it also promts and stores the amount payable by the customer at the time of checkin alongisde the 
inclusion of room service.

the exe file can be directly run but the cpp file will need a Ms visual basic 2008 or older
